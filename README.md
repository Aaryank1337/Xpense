`NA`
### Team Members:  
- Aaryan Kalbhor ([GitHub](https://github.com/Aaryank1337) / [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaryan-kalbhor/) / Student)  
- [Add additional team members]
  
### Your Approach:  
- I chose this problem because financial literacy is a critical yet underdeveloped skill among students, leading to poor money management that can impact their future financial health.
- Key challenges I addressed include making financial education engaging through gamification, implementing blockchain rewards that have real value, and creating personalized AI coaching that adapts to individual spending patterns.
- My breakthrough moment came when I integrated the Stellar blockchain for EDU token rewards with the AI-powered coaching system, creating a cohesive ecosystem that both educates and incentivizes good financial habits.
