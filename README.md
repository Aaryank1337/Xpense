This project is a full-stack gamified student expense tracker with tokenization and AI-powered financial coaching. The backend is built with Node.js and Express, using MongoDB for data storage, and includes models for users, expenses, books, community posts, daily savings, quizzes, and transactions. The frontend is a React application with Material-UI for UI components, featuring modules for expense tracking, a book store, a community feed, daily saving streaks, and a quiz game. Stellar blockchain integration is used for EDU token rewards and transactions, including wallet management and token transfers for various activities like quizzes, savings, and book purchases. AI features are powered by Groq's API, providing personalized financial advice and spending analysis, while the application also includes robust error handling, authentication, and a leaderboard for gamification.
